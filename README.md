Programming in R and Python 

This course provides an introduction to programming in Python and R, two of the most popular languages for data analytics. The course starts out by covering basic programming concepts, such as data types and inputting/outputting data from/to the user. We then cover basic control flow, including conditionals and loops. Finally, we will cover functions, program design, basic algorithms, and data structures. Most of the course materials will be introduced through Python and the final lectures will help students to port this knowledge to R.
