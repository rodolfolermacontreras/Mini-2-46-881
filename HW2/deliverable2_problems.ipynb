    "The SIR model is the original and simplest (in fact, *simplistic*) model of disease spread in epidemiology. It is a *compartmental model* where each individual in a population is classified as being in exactly one of 3 states at any gien time: **S**usceptible to infection, **I**nfectious (i.e. infected and capable of infecting susceptible individuals), or **R**ecovered (or \"removed\"). The model was developed by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927. Many improved predictive models have since been developed for disease spread. In this problem you will use Python to implement and explore this model."
